Other terms sometimes used to describe these features are: grounding \npins, ESD contacts, grounding contacts, static drain, and pre-grounding contacts. \n \nAlignment guides:  Connector features that preposition insulators prior to \nelectrical contact.  Other terms sometimes used to describe these features are: \nguide pins, guide posts, blind mating features, mating features, alignment \nfeatures, paddle card chamfers and mating guides. \n \nCenterline or CL:  A real or imaginary line that is equidistant from the surface or \nsides of something \n \nContact mating sequence:  Order of electrical contact during mating/unmating \nprocess.  Other terms sometimes used to describe this feature are: contact \nsequencing, contact positioning, make first/break last, EMLB (early make late \nbreak) staggered contacts, and long pin / short pin. \n \nFrontshell:  That metallic part of a connector body that directly contacts the \nbackshell or other shielding material that provides mechanical and shielding \ncontinuity between the connector and the cable.  Other terms sometimes used to \ndescribe this part of a cable assembly are: housing, nosepiece, cowling, and metal \nshroud.  \n \nMaximum component height:  Distance from board surface to farthest overall \nmodule/connector feature. \n \nMating side:  The side of the connector that joins and separates from the mating \nside of a connector of opposite gender.  Other terms commonly used in the industry \nare mating interface, separable interface and mating face. \n \nOffset:  An alignment shift from the centerline of the connector. Connector \ncontacts may be offset from the CL \n \nOptional:  This term describes features that are not required by this \nspecification. However, if any feature defined by this specification is \nimplemented, it shall be done in the same way as defined by the specification. \nDescribing a feature as optional in the text is done to assist the reader. If there \nis a conflict between text and tables on a feature described as optional, the table \nshall be accepted as being correct.  \n \nRight Angle:  A connector design for use with printed circuit board assembly \ntechnology where the mating direction is parallel to the plane of the printed \ncircuit board. \n\n--- End of Page 7 ---\n\n Published                                                        SFF-8071 Rev 1.7 \n \n \nSFP+ 1X 0.8mm Card Edge Connector                                           Page 8  \n \nSurface mount:  A connector design and a printed circuit board design style where \nthe connector termination points do not penetrate the printed circuit board and are \nsubsequently soldered to the surface of the printed circuit board. \n \nTermination side:  The side of the connector opposite the mating side that is used \nfor permanently attaching conductors to the connector.  Due to pin numbering \ndifferences between mating side genders the termination side shall always be \nspecified in conjunction with a mating side of a specific gender.  Other terms \ncommonly used in the industry are: back end, non-mating side, footprint, pc board \nside, and post side. \n \nThrough-hole:  A connector design and a printed circuit board design style where \nthe connector termination points penetrates the printed circuit board and are \nsubsequently soldered to the printed circuit board.",

    "text": "The 0.8 mm connection system is based on industry-proven card edge style contacts, \nwhich mate with a single wipe. \n\n0.8 mm Card Edge connectors find their most important application where signals\nhave rise times typically in the range of 25 ps and where positive retention is \nneeded but ease of insertion and removal is also desired. This covers virtually all \nof the external inter-enclosure applications for gigabit serial applications that \nuse balanced copper media for transmission. \n \nDesign goals were minimization of crosstalk and minimum transmission line impedance \ndiscontinuity across the connector interface at the specified signaling rates on \nthe upper row of contacts. The lower row of contacts is rated at signaling rates up \nto 2.5 Gb/s. \n \nThe shield (cage) contact (not shown or part of this specification) is required to \nmake contact before any of the signal contacts upon insertion and to break contact \nonly after all contacts are separated upon removal. This ensures that any ground \npotential differences between enclosures are first exposed to the shield and \nthereby minimizes the risk of damaging the sensitive input and output stages of the \ntransceivers when the signal contacts are mated. \n \nA cage or latching device (not shown or part of this specification) is required to \nguide the mating interface (paddle card) into the connector, provide sufficient \nwipe on the contact interface, provide a hard stop which prevents the transceiver \nside from bottoming in the connector, and keeps the paddle card contacts on the \nconnector contacts during use. \n \nThis connector is mated with either a pluggable module or a direct attach cable \nassembly. \n \nThis specification includes the minimum lengths, widths and positional tolerances \nof the contacts.  \n \n \n \n\n--- End of Page 9 ---\n\n Published                                                        SFF-8071 Rev 1.7 \n \n \nSFP+ 1X 0.8mm Card Edge Connector                                           Page 10",
